### Steps to run the app and export traces to your New Relic Account:

This assumes you have `npm` installed on your machine.

export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT=https://otlp.nr-data.net:4318/v1/traces

```

Replace `<YOUR_LICENSE_KEY>` with your [New Relic ingest license key](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/api-keys-ui.api-keys-launcher).
